Olympics games are the leading international sporting events which are normally held every four years, alternating between the Summer and Winter Olympics every two years in the four-year period. Summer, Winter Olympics, YOG & Paralympics.

In this project, we are going to see the Olympics dataset analysis using Python. The modern Olympic Games or Olympics are leading international sports events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the worldâ€™s foremost sports competition with more than 100 nations participating.

This dataset contains historic information about the olympics games happened from year 2000 to 2012. The total number of unique sports in the Olympics are 49 during these years and for each sports there are multiple winners based on bronze, silver and gold medals for that year. Therefore various data is generated. So, by using Python we will analyze this data.

Also as different countries participating we will analyse the relative performance of the various countries. in diiferent sports in different years and overall(cumulative). In this Project we will also take key insights from the different visualizations using Matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

Overall analysis like how many sports are played, how many countries are participated etc is done. Then did country wise analysis like graph many medals won through the years. And also, athletes wise analysis is done to analyse performance of top athletes.
